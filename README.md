# WebGL NPC Environment

Viewed at: https://samsilver.ca/computer-graphics-project/

This is a lab final for my computer graphics course. My inital idea was to re-create the Mii Channel from the Wii console within the broswer.

## Tech
I used Javascript with WebGL to create this project from scratch. I implemented the phong model to add lighting to the envrionment via a controllable light. I created NPCs with geometric shapes by generating vertices in code; I created Spheres and cubes with this approch. I also added textures found online to shapes to give the NPCs personality.

## Future Plans
This project was fun to create. I learned a lot by implementing WebGL from scratch. I hope to improve my skills in future projects by implementing:
- Faster load times
- Imported models from external tools
- A more realstic scene with shadows, and better models, and textures
